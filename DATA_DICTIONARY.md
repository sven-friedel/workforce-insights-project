## üîç Notes
- The dataset includes intentional imperfections (e.g. missing roles, non-numeric salaries) to simulate real-world data cleaning tasks.
- The `Upskilled` column is derived: `Yes` if `Training Status` is "Completed" or "Inprogress".
- Useful for portfolio analysis around attrition, training effectiveness, regional gaps, and performance correlations.
