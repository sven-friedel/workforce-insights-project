# ðŸš—ðŸ“ˆ Project Title: "Workforce Insights for a Software-Driven Automotive Future"
## ðŸ“˜ Project Summary
As the automotive industry transitions toward software-defined vehicles (SDVs), manufacturers face increasing pressure to secure top-tier software development talent. In this project, I analyzed simulated HR workforce data from a global automotive company to uncover trends and risks related to hiring, attrition, and software talent readiness.

The goal was to deliver executive-level insights and recommendations that align workforce planning with the companyâ€™s strategic SDV transformation â€” a critical shift reshaping the entire automotive sector.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Questions Explored
1. How are hiring and attrition rates trending for software development roles across global regions?

2. Are internal upskilling and training programs closing the gap in SDV-critical skills?

3. Which departments or locations are at the greatest risk of software talent shortages?

4. What hiring channels are most effective for sourcing in-demand tech talent?
