# 🚗📈 Project Title: "Workforce Insights for a Software-Driven Automotive Future"
## 📘 Project Summary
As the automotive industry transitions toward software-defined vehicles (SDVs), manufacturers face increasing pressure to secure top-tier software development talent. In this project, I analyzed synthetic HR workforce data from a global automotive supplier company to uncover trends and risks related to hiring, attrition and software talent readiness.

The goal was to deliver executive-level insights and recommendations that align workforce planning with the company’s strategic SDV transformation.

## 💡 Key Questions Explored
1. How are hiring and attrition rates trending for software development roles across global regions?

2. Are internal upskilling and training programs closing the gap in SDV-critical skills?

3. Which departments or locations are at the greatest risk of software talent shortages?

4. What hiring channels are most effective for sourcing in-demand tech talent?
